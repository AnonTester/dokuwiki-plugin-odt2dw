This plugin works with Apache HTTP Server on Linux Environment.
Apache versions tested : V.5.2, V.5.3

I don't test it on other HTTP Server.

This plugin need :
  * php xsltProcessor class (ex : php-xml, php5-xsl)
  * php zipArchive class

ToDo :
  * Fixe parserPostDisplay : when edit or preview are choose,
    it display a blank page although the data has correctly been saved.

Change Log :

v0.06 beta
  * Fixe : some small fixes to the english messages
  * Fixe : check for mime type was too specific. it could be set in config panel
